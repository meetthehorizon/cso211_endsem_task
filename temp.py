This PyTorch-based project centred on predicting molecular properties using a provided dataset and incorporated graph neural networks (GNNs). Leveraging PyTorch for preprocessing, which included handling missing data and normalization, the dataset comprising SMILES strings was transformed into atomic coordinates, substrings, and molecular images using GNNs, with crucial assistance from RDKit.

Implemented in PyTorch, three GNN modelsâ€”GemNet, DimeNet, and SczhNet were trained across varying granularity levels. Optimization assessments using PyTorch and RDKit involved fine tuning hyperparameters and adjusting the architecture for improved model performance. Performance metrics, encompassing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score calculated with PyTorch and visualized using Matplotlib facilitated a robust comparison of model efficacy at different granularity levels.

In conclusion, this GNN-based project, implemented with PyTorch and RDKit, contributes to molecular property prediction by exploring the strengths of GemNet, DimeNet, and SczhNet models. The comprehensive approach, from PyTorch-based preprocessing to GNN model application, RDKit integration, and optimization assessment, provides valuable insights for drug discovery and materials science applications, with results visualized through Matplotlib.

2. Aerial Semantic Segmentation with Custom U-Net Model

This project involved implementing a U-Net model from scratch using PyTorch for semantic segmentation in aerial images, specifically evaluating its performance on a Kaggle dataset. The custom U-Net architecture was designed to preserve spatial information crucial for segmentation tasks. Utilizing Python Imaging Library (PIL) and OpenCV (cv2) for image processing, the project seamlessly integrated these libraries into the workflow.

The Kaggle dataset provided annotated images for both training and evaluation. The U-Net model's performance was rigorously assessed, with Matplotlib used for result visualization, offering a qualitative insight into segmentation accuracy. This streamlined approach showcased the efficiency of the custom U-Net model for aerial detection tasks.

In conclusion, the project's synthesis of PyTorch, PIL, cv2, and Matplotlib contributed to a robust workflow for aerial semantic segmentation. The custom U-Net model's effectiveness was demonstrated through the evaluation of the Kaggle dataset, providing valuable insights for future developments in computer vision and image analysis, particularly in aerial image segmentation."""
